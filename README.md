# TaskProjector

Task management apps are a dime a dozen, but few apps do much to help you with prioritizing what to do now. TaskProjector not only tracks your tasks, projects, and due dates, but will also give you a suggested order of accomplishing your tasks based on due date, time estimate, tags, and other optional task properties. It will also inform you if, for any particular period, you are overencumbered and need to get help by delegating tasks or recruiting help.
